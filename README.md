## Wait a minute, what the hell is Wowza?
From the Wowza site:

_Wowza Streaming Engineâ„¢ is robust, customizable media server software that powers reliable streaming of high-quality video and audio to any device, anywhere._

_Wowza software is platform-agnostic, multi-format, and multi-screen. It takes in any video format, transcodes it once, and reliably delivers it in multiple formats and with the highest possible quality_

```

Wowza needs several user actions on the interactive prompt portion of the installer:
- an acknowledgement of acceptance of their terms
- an administrative user added for using the Wowza console
- a password for the administrative user
- confirmation of that password
- Wowza license key
- an acknowledgement of whether or not you want Wowza to start at boot

Fill these values in, in vars/main.yml. I've already taken the liberty of answering "yes" for the acceptance of terms,
and whether or not you want Wowza to start at boot, but you can easily change that, should you feel the need. Those 
values can be edited in the template/script.exp.j2 file.
